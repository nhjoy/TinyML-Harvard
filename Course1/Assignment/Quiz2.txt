1. Overfitting is a problem because while the model may seem to have low error in reality it will perform quite poorly on:
ans: B, C, and D

2. Having separate training, validation, and test data sets:
ans: Allows for better testing of overfitting

3. The step that often takes the most time in the development of machine learning applications is:
ans: Preparing a dataset

4. Which of the following are true (select all that apply):
ans: Regression outputs a value and Classification outputs a probability

5. Inference is when:
ans: A model is run to make a prediction

6. ReLU and Softmax are two examples of:
ans: Activation functions

7. TensorFlow can:
ans: All of the above

8. When we ran model.predict on the test data we got out lists of ten decimal values. What did they represent?
ans: It's the probability that the item is each of the 10 classes

9. When you doubled the number of Neurons in the model, what was the impact (select all that apply)?
ans: Training took longer and The accuracy went up

10. How did we teach the model to exit early in training in certain cases?
ans: We added a callback function
