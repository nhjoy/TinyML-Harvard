1. Convolutions allow for all of the following except:
ans: Collect time series data to understand trends

2. Pooling Layers are:
ans: Are used in tandem with convolution layers

3. This is because:
ans: Convolutional layers extract features and pooling layers summarize them

4. Which of the following is NOT true:
ans: Training updates the parameters in the pooling layers of a CNN

5. Which of the following is true:
ans: None of the above

6. Filters can be used to:
ans: All of the above

7. True, False, or Other: While many loss functions could work in this example, the most effective loss functions focused on categorical separation in the data.
ans: True

8. When you found your optimizer as compared to stochastic gradient descent it had (select all that apply):
ans: Higher training accuracy
     Higher or Similar (+/- 5%) validation accuracy

9. This is because it:
ans: Found a good solution faster (in less epochs)
