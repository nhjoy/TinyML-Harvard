1. TinyML exists at the intersection of all of the below EXCEPT
ans: Quantum Computing

2. TinyML would be a good option for which of the following scenarios? (check all that apply)
ans: Designing smart anomaly detection sensors placed on remote oil pipelines.
     Building a smart elephant tracking collar that can detect injuries.
     
3. Why are the scenario(s) you selected good options for TinyML? Select the best option.
ans: They require low power computations

4. Which of the following is NOT true about microcontrollers (MCUs)?
ans: They run the open source linux operating system

5. Why is TinyML hard? (check all that apply)
ans: MCUs do not always provide support for accurate floating point math
     MCUs are memory constrained making it hard to fit Neural Networks on the device
     
6. Which of the following is/are NOT true (check all that apply)?
ans: Standard libraries and floating point support are needed to run TinyML models.
     MCUs can support any neural network

7. How are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning related?
ans: How are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning related?

8. What is the best way to characterize the role of AI/technology?
ans: AI is disruptive, it will offer new benefits as well as new risks and challenges

9. In order to meet the growing demand for Responsible AI, at which point in a productâ€™s lifecycle should ethics be involved?
ans: At every stage (design, development and deployment)
