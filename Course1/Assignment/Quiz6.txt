1. Machine Learning datasets can be imported into TensorFlow code through the use of
ans: All of the above

2. When the training set has lower error than the validation set
ans: There may be overfitting as the model isnâ€™t generalizing well

3. The best optimizer for all Neural Networks is:
ans: The best optimizer for all Neural Networks is:

4. Designing, collecting, and preprocessing data sets takes up how much of an average data scientist's time?
ans: 50% or more

5. Why?
ans: Often custom datasets need to be collected which is time consuming but TFDS and Generators can help reduce that burden

6. Data Augmentation provides alternate versions of the same images which can be used to
ans: A and B

7. Temporarily removing nodes during training is called
ans: Dropout Regularization

8. In this assignment you created Generators for
ans: A and B

9. Using the Generators you could easily apply (although you may not have chosen to do this)
ans: A and B

10. Between Convolutional and Dense layers you need to apply a
ans: Flattening Layer

11. Why?
ans: Because Convolutions are higher dimensional than Dense layers

12. After training your model how well was the final validation accuracy
ans: Better than 60%
