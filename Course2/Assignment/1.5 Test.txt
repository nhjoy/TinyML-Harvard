Question 1

To be deployed to the real world keyword spotting applications need to:
Answer:
Handle streaming audio in an always on fashion


Question 2

Spectrograms provide higher level features to Neural Networks because they:
Answer:
Expose both the frequency and time domain

Question 3

MFCCs provide higher level features than Spectrograms to Neural Networks because they:
Answer:
Take into account limitations in human audio perception

Question 4

Cascade architectures are used to:
Answer:
Improve accuracy and power consumption through a compute hierarchy

Question 5

Which of the following are true:
Answer:
False positives can invade user privacy by falsely sending data to the cloud
False negatives can cause user frustration by never triggering

Question 6

The operating point for a keyword spotting system:
Answer:
Should be adjusted based on its environment after deployment

Question 7

To fit a keyword spotting model onto a microcontroller you need to consider:
Answer:
How to design a small model
How to quantize a model to reduce its size
The size of the audio buffer needed to support the model
The size of the wrapper code needed to support the model

Question 8

Keyword Spotting applications can tolerate small models because:
Answer:
They are only trying to identify a few particular words
They can leverage the cloud to do the majority of the actual speech recognition tasks
They are often deployed using cascade architectures

Question 9

Having an always on keywords spotting model on a microcontroller:
Answer:
Helps protect the users privacy as it only records and sends data to the cloud when triggered

Question 10

Pete’s Keyword Spotting Dataset:
Answer:
Is designed to serve as a limited starter dataset
Includes background noise
Has recordings from many users to improve generalizability

Question 11

Quality of experience is an important metric because:
Answer:
If users don’t enjoy the application they won’t use it

Question 12

When you trained your custom model you needed to use:
Answer:
More than 100 training iterations

Question 13

When you trained your custom model how many words were you able to use and still have it be relatively accurate:
Answer:
Less than 15 words
