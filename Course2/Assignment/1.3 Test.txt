Question 4

Which of the following is true about Quantization Aware Training (QAT)?:
Answer:
Allows us to quantize during training which can improve accuracy

Answer:
Provides a mobile optimized inference engine for TensorFlow models

Question 6

In your quantization assignment, how accurate was the initial model in training/validation vs. in test after quantization?:
Answer:
It was about 100% accurate in training/validation and about 80% accurate in test after quantization
