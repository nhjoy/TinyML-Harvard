1. Machine Learning Algorithms are different than traditional computer algorithms in that they:
ans: Use data to learn rules

2. We can use a loss function to:
ans: A and B

3. A randomly selected learning rate:
ans: All of the above

4. Neural network parameters:
ans: Get updated during training

5. Machine Learning applications:
ans: None of the above

6. All of the following are kinds of layers except:
ans: Reverse

7. How many layers did you use in your model:
ans: One

8. For most Epochs (Epochs â‰¥ 25) did the data fit better when the output, y, was positive or negative?
ans: Positive

9. Why did this happen?
ans: Our dataset half as many negative points so it was less likely to find a good fit for them.
